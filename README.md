# BHA SterileHood

This repo contains the designs and source files of a **DIY Sterilehood**. This device can be used to work with microbes and tissue culture asepticly. Since the flow is directly straight into your face, it is only suitable for Biosafety Level 1 work. Check out the corresponding [BHA lecture in the Syllabus](http://biohackacademy.github.io) for more information.

## Releases

The BioHack Academy 3 release contains the following:

* 2015 BHA1 Design
* 2015 BHA2 Design
* 2016 BHA3 Design

## Flow Calculations & Fan

* Inlet size: 41cm x 32cm
* Desired Airflow: 0.5m airflow/sec.

`0.41 * 0.32 * 0.5 = 0.0656 m^3/sec`
` → 0.0656 * 60 = 3.936 m^3/min` 
` → 0.0656 * 60 * 60 = 236.16 m^3/hr` 

120mm Computer Fan, 100V, Maximum airflow rate (m^3/ min) (50/60 Hz) 2.5 / 2.9
